Sensor placement design files are in json format:
Example:
{
    "design": 
    [
        ["gaussian", [60, 60], [-54, -32]],
        ["gaussian", [60, 60], [49, -32]],
        ["gaussian", [60, 60], [49, 28]],
        ["gaussian", [60, 60], [-54, 28]]
    ],
    "output":
    [
        [1, -1, -1, 1],
        [1, 1, -1, -1]
    ],
    "coord_space": "cartesian"
}

Each sensor is described using following format:
[type, [sizex, sizey], [posx, posy]]
where:
type:	type of sensor. Currently only "gaussian" is suported
sizex:	radius of gaussian kernel, in pixels
sizey:	not used
posx:	sensor offset in horizontal direction (pixels from screen center) 
posy:	sensor offset in vertical direction (pixels from screen center) 

In case of "coord_space": "polar"
sizex:	not used
sizey:	not used
posx:	radius of gaussian kernel, in pixels
posy:	angle in degrees

"output" controls how raw sensor responses are combined. For example [1, 1, -1, -1] means adding raw responses of first two sensors and substracting responses of the rest two. Can be left empty if only raw responses are used.
